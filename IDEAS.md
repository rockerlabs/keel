# Ideas — raw-idea staging tier

Keel's own instance of the tier `templates/IDEAS.md` describes: raw ideas about Keel itself, parked so
they aren't lost to a chat transcript, and kept out of the always-loaded surfaces and the backlog until
one earns a next step. Format: `- [date] idea — context (where it came from)`. Reviewed at `/wrap` /
periodic review — promote to the backlog once actionable, or drop explicitly. (Ideas != Backlog: a next
step may never materialize, and that's fine.)

## Ideas

- [2026-07-20] **Contributor-docs line: agent commit trailers vs the SEC4 commit-message scan** — felt
  on PR #106: a coding harness's session-URL commit trailer matched the key-shape patterns and the CI
  scan blocked the push; resolved by stripping the trailer (no allowlist, per the gate's own rule). One
  line in contributor-facing docs would save the next agent session the rediscovery.
- [2026-07-20] **The ladder from the `--no-git` trim to real always-on modules** — from the PR #106
  design discussion: the strip-generation approach was chosen over two-module composition (CORE +
  `CORE-GIT.md`, one `@import` line each) to keep the majority path unchanged; if a *third* optional
  always-on module ever materializes, switch to composition — the `KEEL-GIT` markers already fix the
  module boundary, so the migration stays mechanical. Next module candidate: the Memory section
  (`ADAPTING.md` already tells tools without cwd-keyed auto-memory to drop it). Not actionable until a
  second real module shows demand.
