# Pre-PR gate — the enforcement half of the /polish → PR flow.
#
# MAINTAINER DEV-TOOLING — pairs with commands/polish.md. This is a Claude-Code-specific pre-PR workflow
# gate for the maintainer's own use; install.sh deliberately does NOT ship it (or /polish) to adopters, so
# nobody gets a half-wired command. It lives here for the maintainer + downstream consumers. (Intentional —
# a future audit should read this as scoped, not as a half-shipped feature.)
#
# Wire it as a Claude Code PreToolUse(Bash) hook: it intercepts `gh pr create` and requires /polish
# (simplify + inline review + tests) to have run on the current HEAD. The bypass path is closed by
# content, not just presence: each polish step appends a receipt line (see below), and the gate denies
# unless every expected step id is present AND the final step's recorded SHA matches live HEAD — so a
# bare `touch` (empty file), a partial run, or a sentinel from an earlier commit all fail.
# Unlock: run /polish — it writes the receipt automatically as it completes each step.
#
# --- receipt format (dir #49) ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The sentinel is no longer a bare SHA — it's a small per-run receipt at the same path/keying:
#   nonce\t<run-id>                     (line 1, written by `init`)
#   <run-id>\t<step-id>\t<outcome>      (one per step, written by `receipt`, in any order)
# Only lines carrying the CURRENT run's nonce count — a leftover line from an earlier run (a different
# nonce) is invisible to the completeness check, so a stale receipt can't be replayed just because it
# happens to still list the right step ids. `polish.8-unlock`'s outcome IS the HEAD SHA, so its presence
# doubles as both the last step id and the existing SHA effect-check — no separate finalize step needed.
#
# CLI subcommands (used by commands/polish.md, so a step never needs a raw `echo >>`):
#   pre-pr-gate.sh init                    mint a fresh nonce, start a new receipt (run from repo root)
#   pre-pr-gate.sh receipt <step-id> [outcome]   append a receipt line for the current run (outcome default: done)
#   pre-pr-gate.sh log <type> [detail]     append a line to the impact log (same resolution as the guard event)
#
# With no subcommand, it runs as the PreToolUse(Bash) hook: reads the tool-call JSON event on stdin,
# decides allow/deny for `gh pr create`.

# Fast-exit: only care about `gh pr create` in real command position (backlog dir #58 — replaces the
# earlier substring match, S6/backlog dir #4, which false-fired on any command merely CONTAINING the
# phrase: a KB write whose heredoc/quoted TEXT mentioned it, a commit message, a grep for the phrase
# itself). A small lexer over $cmd: strips heredoc bodies, strips quoted spans, splits on command
# separators (`;` `&` `|` `&&` `||` `(` `)` backtick, `$(`, newline), then per segment skips leading
# `VAR=value` assignments and `env`/`command` wrappers (incl. their own flags/assignments) and matches
# iff the first remaining token is exactly `gh`, followed later by `pr`, followed later by `create` —
# any tokens in between. That also closes the `gh --repo owner/name pr create` bypass (a global flag
# before the subcommand, no longer a residual gap) that the old substring match missed.
#
# A second command shape opens a PR without that subcommand at all: `gh api repos/O/R/pulls -f head=…`
# (found 2026-07-26 auditing the dir #57 rework — the natural reach once `gh pr create` is denied). It's
# matched when it is a genuine WRITE to a pulls collection: an endpoint ending in `/pulls` PLUS an
# explicit POST or any field/input flag. Reads stay allowed on purpose — `.../pulls` with no write flag
# (list), `.../pulls/123` (one PR), `.../pulls/123/comments -f body=…` (commenting on an existing PR):
# this gate blocks OPENING a PR, not looking at or annotating one, and a gate that denies status checks
# teaches the next session to route around it.
#
# Still lexical, not a real shell parse: within this model it errs toward catching — an unstripped
# exotic heredoc form, or prose that happens to sit at a real command position, falls through as a
# false positive (an unneeded /polish reminder, not a bypass). Known accepted residuals (this is a
# WORKFLOW gate, not the secret boundary — that's secret-guard): `sh -c 'gh pr create'` / `eval "gh pr
# create"` (quoted → stripped, invisible to the lexer — a conscious regression from the old substring
# match, which DID catch these); `gh "pr" create` (quoting the bare subcommand splits it out of the
# token stream); a `gh` alias/wrapper-script rename; `env -u VAR gh pr create` (an `env` flag that
# takes its own separate value token, e.g. `-u VAR`, is not itself a flag or a `VAR=value` assignment,
# so the skip-loop stops on the value token instead of reaching `gh` — a flag-arity table to handle
# this generically is disproportionate for a workflow gate; the plain-prefix `VAR=value gh pr create`
# and `env VAR=value gh pr create` shapes above remain caught).
